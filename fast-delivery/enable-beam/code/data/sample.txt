Filecoin Beam CDN: Accelerating Decentralized Content Delivery

This sample file demonstrates the power of Beam CDN on Filecoin. Beam is an incentivized data delivery layer that provides CDN-level performance for content stored on the Filecoin network.

Traditional CDNs rely on centralized infrastructure, creating single points of failure and vendor lock-in. Filecoin Beam transforms this model by creating a decentralized network of retrieval providers who compete to deliver your content quickly and reliably.

When you enable Beam CDN with `withCDN: true`, your uploads are optimized for fast retrieval through a global network of providers. These providers are incentivized through a paid-per-byte model, ensuring they maintain high performance and availability.

Key Benefits:
- Global edge distribution for low-latency access
- Provider competition drives performance improvements
- Cryptographic verification ensures data integrity
- No vendor lock-in - switch providers seamlessly
- Pay only for what you use

This tutorial will show you how to enable Beam CDN, compare performance against standard retrieval, and understand the cost implications for production deployments.

Let's explore how decentralized CDN technology can match or exceed traditional cloud providers while maintaining the benefits of Web3 infrastructure!

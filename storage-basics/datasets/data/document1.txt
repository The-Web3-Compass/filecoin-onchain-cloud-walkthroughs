📄 Filecoin Onchain Cloud - Project Documentation

This document contains important project information for the Filecoin storage system.

## Overview
This is a sample document demonstrating multi-file dataset storage on Filecoin's decentralized network. When you store multiple related files together, you can manage them as a cohesive dataset rather than individual pieces.

## Key Benefits
- Unified metadata tagging across related files
- Simplified payment management through dataset-level payment rails
- Easier organization and retrieval of related content
- Proof verification at the dataset level

## Use Cases
Datasets are ideal for:
- Document collections (contracts, reports, archives)
- Photo albums and media libraries
- Code repositories and project files
- Backup sets and disaster recovery data

This file is part of a demonstration dataset showing how Filecoin handles collections of files efficiently.
